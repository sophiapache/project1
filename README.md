### Features
This website allows a user to register for an account and edit his or her profile with personal information, such as name and favorite artists.

On this profile features the events the current user has registered for.

The home page displays around 20 upcoming electronic music events in Australia with corresponding artist and venue pages. 

The user can register for an event and view other users registered for the event, linking to their profiles.

### Improvements
In the future, I would add more aspects of a social media website (ex. Instagram), such as comments and messages.

Thank you Loden and Joel, margaritas on me.
